## Getting Started (For Developers)

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm (Node Package Manager)
-   A Supabase project (for database and authentication)

### Supabase Setup

1.  **Create a Supabase Project**: Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Database Schema**: Apply the schema from `supabase_schema.sql` to your Supabase project. This file contains the necessary table definitions for users, sessions, participants, and songs.
3.  **Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory and add your Supabase project URL and Service Role Key:
        ```
        SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
        SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
        JWT_SECRET="A_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_FOR_JWT"
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory (if needed for client-side Supabase keys, though currently not directly used for Supabase client in frontend, but good practice for future expansion).

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `server/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `client/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server**:
    From the `server/` directory:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Application**:
    From the `client/` directory:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The Angular application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Usage

-   **Register**: Create a new user account. Admins can register via `/admin/signup` with a secret key.
-   **Login**: Log in with your credentials.
-   **Create Session (Admin)**: Admins can create new jam sessions, selecting a song to start with.
-   **Join Session**: Users can join existing public sessions.
-   **Live View**: Participate in real-time sessions, see other participants, and view synchronized lyrics/chords.
-   **Change Song (Admin)**: Admins can search for and change the current song during a live session.
-   **End Session (Admin)**: Admins can end a session, which will redirect all participants.
